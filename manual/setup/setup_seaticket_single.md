# Setup SeaTicket Server

## Getting started

The following assumptions and conventions are used in the rest of this document:

- `/opt/seaticket` is the directory for store SeaTicket docker compose files. If you decide to put SeaTicket in a different directory — which you can — adjust all paths accordingly.
- SeaTicket uses some [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) for persisting data generated in its database and SeaTicket Docker container. The volumes' [host paths](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes) like `/opt/caddy-data` and `/opt/seaticket-data`, respectively. It is not recommended to change these paths. If you do, account for it when following these instructions.
- All configuration and log files for SeaTicket are stored in the volume of the SeaTicket container.
- SeaTicket contains following components, each packaged as a separate docker image:
    - Caddy and seaqa-web
    - seaqa-ai
    - seaqa-events
    - seaqa-indexer


## Preparing seaticket_db

Before starting SeaTicket, you need to create MySQL user `seaticket` and create the database `seaticket_db`.

Copy `mysql.sql` file to the host `/tmp` directory:

```bash
docker run --rm -v /tmp:/shared seaticket/seaqa-web:1.0-latest cp /opt/seaticket/seaqa-web/sql/mysql.sql /shared
```

Create the MySQL user `seaticket` and create the database `seaticket_db`:

```bash
mysql -u root -p

# then input the following commands
CREATE DATABASE seaticket_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
CREATE USER seaticket@'%' IDENTIFIED BY <SEAQA_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD>;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON seaticket_db.* TO 'seaticket'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

USE seaticket_db;
SOURCE /tmp/mysql.sql;
```

## Download and modify `.env`, `config.yml`

To deploy SeaTicket with Docker, you have to `.env`, `caddy.yml`, `seaqa-web.yml`, `seaqa-indexer.yml`, `seaqa-ai.yml`, `seaqa-events.yml`, and `config.yml` in a directory (e.g., `/opt/seaticket`):

```bash
mkdir /opt/seaticket
cd /opt/seaticket

wget -O .env https://manual.seaticket.ai/main/repo/docker/seaticket/env
wget https://manual.seaticket.ai/main/repo/docker/seaticket/config.yml
wget https://manual.seaticket.ai/main/repo/docker/seaticket/caddy.yml
wget https://manual.seaticket.ai/main/repo/docker/seaticket/seaqa-web.yml
wget https://manual.seaticket.ai/main/repo/docker/seaticket/seaqa-indexer.yml
wget https://manual.seaticket.ai/main/repo/docker/seaticket/seaqa-ai.yml
wget https://manual.seaticket.ai/main/repo/docker/seaticket/seaqa-events.yml

vim .env
```

The following fields merit particular attention:

## Start SeaTicket server

Modify `COMPOSE_FILE` in `.env` file:

```env
COMPOSE_FILE='caddy.yml,seaqa-web.yml'
```

Start SeaTicket server with the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


## Add admin account

```bash
docker exec -it seaqa-web /scripts/reset-admin.sh
```

Enter the username and password according to the prompts. You now have a new admin account.

Finially, you can go to `http://seaticket.example.com` to use SeaTicket.

## Deploy other components

You can deploy other components of SeaTicket, such as seaqa-ai, seaqa-events, seaqa-indexer.

Copy `/opt/seaticket` to other machines.

Modify `COMPOSE_FILE` in `.env` file:

```env
COMPOSE_FILE='seaqa-ai.yml'
```

Start server with the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## SeaTicket directory structure

Placeholder spot for shared volumes. You may elect to store certain persistent information outside of a container, in our case we keep various log files and upload directory outside. This allows you to rebuild containers easily without losing important information.

### Path `/opt/seadb-data`

* /opt/seadb-data: This is the directory for seaticket server configuration and data.
    * /opt/seaticket-data/logs: This is the directory that would contain the log files of seaticket server processes. For example, you can find seadb logs in `/opt/seadb/logs/seadb.log`.

### Path `/opt/seaticket-data`

* /opt/seaticket-data: This is the directory for seaticket server configuration and data.
    * /opt/seaticket-data/logs: This is the directory that would contain the log files of seaticket server processes. For example, you can find seaqa-web logs in `/opt/seaticket/logs/seaqa-web.log`.
    * /opt/seaticket-data/seaqa-web-data: This is the directory that would contain the avatar files of seaticket server processes.

## Find logs

To monitor container logs (from outside of the container), please use the following commands:

```bash
# if the `.env` file is in current directory:
docker compose logs --follow
# if the `.env` file is elsewhere:
docker compose --env-file /path/to/.env logs --follow

# you can also specify container name:
docker compose logs seaqa-web --follow
# or, if the `.env` file is elsewhere:
docker compose --env-file /path/to/.env logs seaqa-web --follow
```

The SeaTicket logs are under `/shared/logs` in the docker, or `/opt/seaticket/logs` in the server that run the docker.

To monitor all SeaTicket logs simultaneously (from outside of the container), run

```bash
sudo tail -f $(find /opt/seaticket/logs/ -type f -name *.log 2>/dev/null)
```
